# substitution-cypher
I wrote a quick substitution cypher in Python to play around with how basic cryptography works.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo by navigating to your dev folder in the terminal and entering `git clone https://github.com/nat-foo/substitution-cypher.git`.
2. Open the folder in VSCode.
3. In the terminal, run the program with `python3 substitution.py`.
  - You may need to install Python if you haven't already done so, or may have an alias for `python3` as simply `python`.
